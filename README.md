## Kid-Friendly Coding Guidelines

- Write code and comments like you are explaining the story to a curious 12-year-old friend.
- Use clear names (for example, `friendly_logger` instead of cryptic abbreviations).
- Add a short cheerful comment before every logic block that says what is happening and why it matters.
- When something breaks, print a gentle hint describing how to fix it.
- Keep lessons in mind: small steps, tests first, and celebrate each working piece.
